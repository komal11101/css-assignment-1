<h3>What is CSS?</h3>

<ol type="1">
    <li> CSS stands for cascading style sheet</li>
    <li> CSS describes how html, elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media</li>
    <li><b><del>CSS is not necessary</del><mark style="color: red;"> CSS saves a lot of work.</mark></b> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li>
    <li><a href="index.css" target="_blank">External Stylesheet are stored in CSS files.</a></li>
</ol>

<h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>

<ul>
    <li style="color: red;">Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements </li>
    <li id="inter">Internal- by using a style element in the head section.</li>
    <li id>External- by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
    <li>The most common way to add css. is to keep the styles in external css file. however <mark style="color: red;">in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</mark >because this is easier to demonstrate and easier or you to try it to yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p id="para1">when comparing css class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements, ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL. to link directly to an element and it's used by javaScript.</p>

<p id="para2">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage. once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>

<p id="para3">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
